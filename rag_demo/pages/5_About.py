This is a Proof of Concept application which shows how GenAI can be used with Neo4j to build and consume Knowledge Graphs using text data.
Using LLM, SEC EDGAR filings are converted to Knowledge Graph.

### Why Neo4j is a great addition to GenAI:
- *Fine-grained access control of your data* : You can control who can and cannot access parts of your data
- Greater reliability with factual data
- More Explainability
- Domain specificity
- Ability to gain insights using Graph Algorithms
- Vector embedding support and Similarity Algorithms on Neo4j
